If you are facing this issues and there are multiple files in your local branch which needs to be pulled first into your MASTER branch, then you must run '$ git pull --all' first.

Then, check the status by running "$ git status" on top of it, and if you see any modified files, then you need to 'add' and 'commit' those files first.

Once its done, you can then PUSH the changes to your MASTER branch and this will sync-up your MASTER branch with your local branch.
